# Draftboi
Discord bot that simulates a Paladins draft.

Not really updated anymore due to the competitive scene being killed off and not having a need for it anymore. MIT License means you can do what you want with it now.
Stuff to be aware of:
- written in 3.6.4
- needs asyncio
- needs discord.py
- needs pillow
